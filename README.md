## Hi, I'm Mike :wave:

I am a curious learner with a background in statistics. The common denominator for 11 years as a statistician, 8 years in statistical software and now a growing career in Google is that I love to learn almost as much as I love to share what I learned to help others.

This has lead to a life approach I call Learn > Do > Share.  Let me explain.

**Learn :book:**

The process of reading, listening, observing and THINKING!  To me learning is bringing ideas into my mind and then making sense of them - basically add context to expand my understanding.

**Do :hammer_and_wrench:**

What good is learning if I don't use it?  It is my responsibility to utlize what I learn in my daily work.  This should make me a more creative problem solver.  This makes for more efficient approaches and breakthrough thinking.  Image what happens if we do this together!

**Share :open_hands:**

This is where I get opinionated.  As a society we truely advance as a whole, not as indivduals.  The input of learning is sharing.  By learning you are responsible for doing AND SHARING!!

**All Together Now :book: :heavy_plus_sign: :hammer_and_wrench: :heavy_plus_sign: :open_hand: = :arrow_upper_right:**

Always learning, always doing, always sharing.  And doing this in community means we are all inputing into the each others learning and doing by sharing.  

**Ultimately** each generation gets a faster start because we make it easier by sharing.
