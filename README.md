## Hi, I'm Mike :wave:

I am a lifetime learner with a background in statistics. The common denominator for 11 years as a statistician, 8 years in statistical software and now a growing career in Google cloud is that I love to learn almost as much as I love to share what I learned to help others.

I am passionate about computational engineering and work tirelessly to broaden my exposure. I utilize a wide range of skills and tools to enable deeper inferential and predictive evaluations in highly creative ways. I believe cloud computing is the radical change of our generation that gives us a chance to skip rethinking what we do and think new all over again.
